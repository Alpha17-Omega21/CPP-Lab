/*As the programmer, you are asked to develop a program which allows the user
to enter two readings. The program determines the lower of the two readings
and then displays a message indicating the action to be performed based on the
following table:
Use the â€œif else" statement to complete the program below:
Range of Reading Action to be Taken
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7 or higher                             Increase heat
5 or higher, but less than 7            Wait for 5 minutes then increase heat
2 or higher, but less than 5            Wait for 10 minutes then increase heat
Below 2                                 Turn Off*/
