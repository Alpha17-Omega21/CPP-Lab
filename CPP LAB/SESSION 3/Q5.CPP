/*India is playing a cricket match against Australia. Australia batted first. Their
run rate was 8.2. Now India is batting. Using a C++ program, accept the number
of overs bowled and the runs scored. Calculate the current run rate of India.
The run rate of a cricket match is calculated by dividing the total number of
runs scored against the total number of over bowled. If the current run rate is
above Australi, print "India has a chance to win". If run rate is below 6, print
â€œIndia has a little chance to win". If run rate is below 3, print "India has NO
chance to win".*/
